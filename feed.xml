The established norm is that it is wrong. You are supposed to always consult your doctor. I am not sure how often this is said as a sort of legal hedge (‘I don’t want you to sue me’) or simply out of habit.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Защо България хаби милиарди за да придобие 2 кораба?</title><link href="/2021/06/23/bg-navy01.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Защо България хаби милиарди за да придобие 2 кораба?" /><published>2021-06-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-06-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/2021/06/23/bg-navy01</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Поводът за тази пост е днешната статия в Капитал.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Numpy Array Ranks and Reshaping</title><link href="/2021/01/26/numpy-array-ranks-reshapes.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Numpy Array Ranks and Reshaping" /><published>2021-01-26T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-01-26T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>/2021/01/26/numpy-array-ranks-reshapes</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Accepting a Credit Card: a SaaS application in a nutshell (Stripe, Rails4, Devise3)</title><link href="/2015/08/04/accepting-credit-card-stripe-saas.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Accepting a Credit Card: a SaaS application in a nutshell (Stripe, Rails4, Devise3)" /><published>2015-08-04T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-08-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/2015/08/04/accepting-credit-card-stripe-saas</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Recently I blogged about a light-touch workflow which allows registration without setting a password. This blog post and the accompanying git repository take it from there and add credit card registration via Stripe.
